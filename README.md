# Student Repository Template
This is the template repository to clone and rename for your research.

In order to copy this into a new repository for your work:
1. Go to your personal GitHub URL. For me this would be  https://github.com/wilson-matt
2. Click the green "New" button in the upper righthand corner of the main panel.
3. Enter the Repository name as your last name, first initial, and middle initial all lowercase. Mine would be "wilsonmj".
4. Add a one-sentence description of what you hope to learn in this course.
5. Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page.
6. Github will take you to your new repository. Scroll to the bottom of the page now and click the grey "Import code" button.
7. In the box for "Your old repository's clone URL" copy/paste: https://github.com/SU-RProjects/student-repo-template
8. Click the green "Begin import" at the bottom of the screen.
9. You might be asked to re-enter credentials. Simply enter your email and password.
10. The transfer might take a few minutes. You can wait or GitHub will email you when it's complete.
11. Your repository is ready for use! You can now click the green "code" button on the main repository page and open with GitHub Desktop.



<b>GitHub Desktop:</b>
<br>FIRST: Create a folder in the root C Drive that is "C:\GitHub".
<br>Then, install from: https://desktop.github.com/. It should automatically offer the appropriate install for your OS.
<br>After installing it will ask you to login. Use your email and GitHub password.
<br>Once you are logged into GitHub Desktop, go back to the browser and click the green "code" button under the repository you want to edit.
<br>Then "Open with GitHub Desktop".
<br>It will ask you to choose where you want to save the repository locally. Choose the "C:\GitHub" folder. It is a real pain to change this if you do it wrong, so <i>please</i> follow this direction. You now have successfully cloned the repo locally. 
<br>After making changes, be sure to click the blue "push to origin" button in GitHub Desktop.
<br>If you are working from a Mac: use the root directory and create a "~/GitHub" path in the root. This should allow those of us with PCs to just add a "C:" to the beginning.
<br>This is a pretty good overview of all it has to offer:
